          <b>Ingredients</b>
          <br />
          1/2 pounds ground chuck
          <br />
          2 to 3 dashes Worcestershire sauce
          <br />
          Kosher salt <br />
          Freshly ground black pepper <br />
          8 Portobello mushrooms, stemmed and cleaned <br />
          1 tablespoon olive oil <br />
          1/2 cup freshly grated Swiss cheese <br />
          Drizzles of Dijon mustard <br />
          4 butter lettuce leaves <br />
          8 tomato slices <br />
          1/2 cup crispy jalape√±os (such as French's) <br />
          <br />
          1. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium heat.
          <br />
          2. With your hands, mix the ground chuck, Worcestershire, 1 teaspoon
          kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper thoroughly in a bowl. Form
          the meat into 4 patties. Make an indention with your thumb in the
          center of each patty to keep them from plumping too much when they
          cook. Refrigerate.
